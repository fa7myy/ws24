### **Summary of Chart Parsing**

#### **1. Overview**
Chart parsing is an efficient parsing algorithm that uses **dynamic programming** to **store intermediate parsing results** and **avoid redundant computations**. This method extends **well-formed substring tables (WFSTs)** and represents parsing hypotheses using a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**.

#### **2. Active Charts**
- A **chart** stores **both complete and incomplete constituents**.
- **Dotted edges** (`â€¢`) indicate partially parsed structures, tracking progress.
- **Example**: If `VP â†’ V NP PP`, and we find `V NP`, the chart records that a **VP could start with** `V NP`, but **still needs a PP**.

#### **3. Types of Edges**
- **Self-loop edge**: A hypothesis that a phrase can start at a position.
  - `[VP â†’ â€¢ V NP PP, (i, i)]` (A VP starts at `i`, but nothing is matched yet)
- **Incomplete edge**: Some components have been matched, but more are required.
  - `[VP â†’ V â€¢ NP PP, (i, j)]` (A `V` was matched, expecting `NP PP`)
- **Complete edge**: A full phrase has been matched.
  - `[VP â†’ V NP PP â€¢, (i, k)]` (A `VP` was fully matched from `i` to `k`)
- **Parse edge**: A fully matched **sentence (`S`)** spanning the whole input.

#### **4. The Fundamental Rule**
- If **one incomplete edge** expects a **constituent (`B`)**, and a **complete edge** provides that constituent, the parser combines them:
  - **Example Rule**:
    - Given `[A â†’ Î± â€¢ B Î², (i, j)]` (A phrase `A` expects `B`)
    - And `[B â†’ Î³ â€¢, (j, k)]` (We found `B`)
    - **Then add:** `[A â†’ Î± B â€¢ Î², (i, k)]`

#### **5. Bottom-Up Parsing in Chart Parsing**
- **Starts from words** and builds larger structures:
  1. Adds edges for **words** in the sentence.
  2. Combines matched structures into **phrases**.
  3. Expands phrases until a full **sentence (`S`)** is found.
- **Example Rule: Bottom-Up Initialization**
  - `[word â†’ â€¢, (i, i+1)]` for each word in input.

#### **6. Top-Down Parsing in Chart Parsing**
- **Starts from `S`** and breaks down into sub-structures.
- Uses **three key rules**:
  1. **Initialization Rule:** Starts with `[S â†’ â€¢Î±, (0, 0)]`
  2. **Expand Rule:** Expands expected phrases (`[A â†’ Î±â€¢BÎ², (i, j)]`)
  3. **Match Rule:** Matches predicted words with actual input (`[A â†’ Î±â€¢wj Î², (i, j)]`)

#### **7. The Earley Algorithm**
- A **hybrid** of **top-down** and **bottom-up** approaches.
- Uses:
  - **Predictor Rule** (expands expectations)
  - **Scanner Rule** (matches words)
  - **Completer Rule** (finalizes structures)

#### **8. Chart Parsing in NLTK**
- **NLTK provides implementations** such as:
  - **ChartParser** (general chart parser)
  - **Viterbi Parser** (uses probabilities to find the most likely parse)
  - **Bottom-Up Chart Parser** (efficient probabilistic parsing)

#### **9. Probabilistic Parsing (A* and Viterbi)**
- **A* Parsing**: Finds the **most likely** parse using **dynamic programming**.
- **Viterbi Parsing**: Similar to A*, but only keeps **the best partial parses**.
- **Uses probability scores** from **probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs)**.

#### **10. Practical Applications**
- **Speech Recognition**
- **Machine Translation**
- **Grammar Checking**
- **Question Answering Systems**
