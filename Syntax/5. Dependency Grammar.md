### **Dependency Grammar and Phrase Structure Grammar**

---

## **1. Phrase Structure Grammar vs. Dependency Grammar**
Phrase structure grammar focuses on **how words combine** into **constituents** (e.g., noun phrases, verb phrases).  
Dependency grammar, in contrast, **describes how words relate to each other**, forming a **hierarchical dependency structure**.

- **Phrase Structure Grammar**: Uses rules like **VP ‚Üí V NP** to define phrase composition.
- **Dependency Grammar**: Uses **binary asymmetric relations** where each word has a **head** and **dependents**.

---

## **2. Dependency Structure**
A **dependency representation** is a **directed graph**, where:
- **Nodes** represent **words**.
- **Labeled edges** represent **dependencies** (e.g., subject, object, modifier).
- **Example**:  
  - `"I"` is the **subject (SBJ)** of `"shot"`.  
  - `"in"` is a **noun modifier (NMOD)** of `"elephant"`.

### **Example Dependency Grammar in NLTK**
```python
groucho_dep_grammar = nltk.DependencyGrammar.fromstring("""
    'shot' -> 'I' | 'elephant' | 'in'
    'elephant' -> 'an' | 'in'
    'in' -> 'pajamas'
    'pajamas' -> 'my'
""")
print(groucho_dep_grammar)
```

This defines **dependency relationships** between words without specifying dependency types.

---

## **3. Projective and Non-Projective Dependencies**
- **A dependency graph is projective** if its **edges do not cross** when drawn above words in linear order.
- **Non-projective dependencies** are more common in **languages with flexible word order**.

### **Parsing with a Projective Dependency Parser**
```python
pdp = nltk.ProjectiveDependencyParser(groucho_dep_grammar)
sent = 'I shot an elephant in my pajamas'.split()
trees = pdp.parse(sent)
for tree in trees:
    print(tree)
```
Outputs:
```
(shot I (elephant an (in (pajamas my))))
(shot I (elephant an) (in (pajamas my)))
```
This shows different **dependency parses**, representing **attachment ambiguities**.

---

## **4. Head vs. Dependent Criteria**
To determine **which word is the head** (`H`) and which is the **dependent** (`D`), various criteria exist:
1. **H determines the syntactic function** of the phrase.
2. **H defines the phrase's semantic type**.
3. **H is obligatory**, while **D can be optional**.
4. **H governs D's form** (e.g., agreement, case marking).

### **Example: Prepositional Phrases**
- In **Phrase Structure Grammar**, **PP ‚Üí P NP**.
- In **Dependency Grammar**, **P (head) ‚Üí NP (dependent)**.

Thus, **Phrase Structure Grammar implicitly contains dependency relations**.

---

## **5. Valency and the Lexicon**
**Valency** refers to **how many dependents a verb requires**.
- **Examples**:
  - **"was"** ‚Üí Requires an **Adjective** (`was frightened`).
  - **"saw"** ‚Üí Requires an **NP** (`saw the bear`).
  - **"thought"** ‚Üí Requires an **S (sentence)** (`thought Buster was angry`).
  - **"put"** ‚Üí Requires **NP + PP** (`put the fish on the log`).

### **VP Productions and Their Lexical Heads**
| **VP Rule**   | **Example** |
|--------------|-------------|
| `VP ‚Üí V Adj` | was frightened |
| `VP ‚Üí V NP`  | saw the bear |
| `VP ‚Üí V S`   | thought Buster was angry |
| `VP ‚Üí V NP PP` | put the fish on the log |

In **dependency grammar**, these verbs have **different valencies**, controlling how they combine with other elements.

---

## **6. Subcategorization for Verbs**
To enforce valency constraints, **verbs are divided into subcategories**:
| **Symbol** | **Meaning** | **Example** |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| IV  | Intransitive Verb | "barked" |
| TV  | Transitive Verb | "saw a man" |
| DatV  | Dative Verb | "gave a dog to a man" |
| SV  | Sentential Verb | "said that a dog barked" |

This prevents **ungrammatical sentences**, like:
‚ùå `"Joe put on the log"` (missing NP complement).  
‚úî `"Joe put the fish on the log"` (correct valency).

---

## **7. Complements vs. Modifiers**
- **Complements** are **required** for meaning (e.g., `"saw the bear"` ‚Üí `"the bear"` is necessary).
- **Modifiers** (Adjuncts) are **optional** and can be **repeated** (e.g., `"Chatterer really saw the bear"`).

**Example:** Adding `"really"` as an optional modifier:
```
a. The squirrel really was frightened.
b. Chatterer really saw the bear.
c. Chatterer really thought Buster was angry.
d. Joe really put the fish on the log.
```
The ambiguity in **PP attachment** (e.g., `"in my pajamas"`) affects both **Phrase Structure and Dependency Grammars**.

---

## **8. Challenges of Scaling Up Dependency Grammar**
- **Creating large-scale grammars is difficult** due to:
  - **Complex interactions between grammar rules**.
  - **Increasing ambiguity as coverage expands**.
- **Large-scale projects**:
  - **LFG (Lexical Functional Grammar)** ‚Äì Used in **Pargram Project**.
  - **HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar)** ‚Äì Used in **LinGO Matrix**.
  - **XTAG (Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar)** ‚Äì A rule-based NLP framework.
